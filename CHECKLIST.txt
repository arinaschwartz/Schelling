Have you put your name(s) at the top of the file Schelling.java?

Does your code determine whether a homeowner is satisfied work
properly.  Are you counting his matching neighbors properly for both
interior and boundary homes? Does it work for different combinations
of matching, open, and non-matching neighbors.

Does it determine the number of open spots properly?  Does it examine
all the locations in the grid?

Does it determine all the homeowners who are unsatisfied at the start
of a step?

Does it move unsatisfied homeowners to the first open home that is
acceptable?

Does it handle the fall back case where there are no acceptable homes
for a homeowner?  Does it choose a random open spot properly?

Does it handle the case where a homeowner starts a step being
unsatisfied, but becomes satisfied before it is time to move?  That
is, do such homeowners stay at their current locations?

Does it leave homeowners who start a step being satisfied, but become
unsatisfied in place until the next step?

Does your program stop as soon as all the homeowners are satisfied?  

Does it work properly when given a grid that will never converge?
